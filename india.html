		<h1>Freedom Movement</h1>
		<p>
			We all know the father of our nation and the leader of the Indian struggle for independence was Mahatma Gandi. It was his resilience and undeniable support of the masses he enjoyed that really made an impact in this struggle. He had a unique non-violent way to protest the British that was very effective. Let us look at some significant events that he led and which defined our struggle for independence.
